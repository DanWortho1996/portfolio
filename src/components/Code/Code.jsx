          <p>This was done in the second week of learning JavaScript (JS). Here I learned how to use functions, arrays, loops, objects and so on. I enjoyed the weeks programming; it was a challenge, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

          <p>Making this Drum-Kit Music App was a lot of fun, learning how to use event listeners and implementing them into code such as pressing W to play Bass Drum Sound effect. This event listener taught me a lot because it is used in almost everything right down to a menu click then clicking anywhere off the page to remove the menu drop down.</p>

            <p>I started picking up CSS at this point and learnt more about flex direction and columns, during this we was also to add checkbox and remove box fro such a task if the task had been completed. Here you can add your tasks to the To-Do list and wen you have completed them, tick them off and they will be removed or you can remove them your self via the remove last task button.</p>

            <p>Here is where I started to focus on my CSS moe than I expected too, when I built this app it was extremely plain, they was no background or styling just plain text black and white, they was no CSS at all so I spent a couple hours learning through certain parts I wanted to make look good on my calculator app. I'm no good at maths though so how about you give it a go instead.</p>

            <p>During week 7 we began to learn more about express and data types, like MongoDB & Sequelize. During this week I learned how to build a model schema and a database. I was also able to learn and make how to add users (books) to the database. I really enjoyed this side of coding as it is more Back-End Development. Feel free to check out my code, I hope you like it!</p>

            <p>This was in week 8, I was to learn the difference between sequelize and MongoDB and they really isn't much difference besides the Schema and Methods which can used to add a user, find a user or find all users and/or even delete a user or all users on the database. I still enjoyed this as it was Back-End Development and a lot of riggerous testing to make sure all is correct and working efficiently.</p>

            <p>Starting week 9 I went in with high hopes learning more Back-End Development especially on passwords. I learned how to hashPass and comparePass a password, one being covering password input on Front-End so it is not visible when inpuuting in the password field, two was to protect the pass from the database so if the database was ever hacked or checked by staff member the password would be shown as a bunch of random letters and number from upper-case to lower-case and the characters given/shown wont match the password.</p>

            <p>When I went into week 10, I went in with the knowledge of using and making a database, I went in with confidence knowing to write the function out of the top of my mind. Here we learned how to connect the Front-End & Back-End together linking the Back-end database as the main database and using the Front-End to store new users to the database.</p>

            <p>In our last 2 weeks on the Master Course we was all put into a group and had to collab together on making a app. We decided to come up with a Dog Walking App Community Based, helping others wanting to connect with people and walk their dogs together, maybe even go on dog dates for the dogs. It is intended to be used for Dog Walkers who want to socialise with other Dog Walkers and to also give their own dogs a chance to meet other new dogs and play in the park.</p>
